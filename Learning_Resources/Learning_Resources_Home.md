# Learning Resources for Statistical Analysis (WIP)


While proper data analysis and model construction **can** get obscenely complicated, I believe that is more a function of many small building blocks placed one upon another upon another. The components are simple, but the end product seems daunting. As someone who always struggled with examinations and technical interviews, I only ever saw the latter rather than the former. From a combination of my personal notes and text resources, I hope to compile an easily digestable resource for people like me: the ones who love what statistics can do for them and others, but are intimidated by the hurdle that is **lots of math**.

If you can recite PEMDAS, then I believe anyone can do statistical analysis. It's simply a function of your time, which I hope to minimize; I do encourage everyone to dive deeper into outside resources, because I can ultimately only hope to scratch the surface of such an expansive and dynamic field.[^1]

[^1]: I wanted to be a history teacher when I first started my undergrad at UC Santa Cruz, so I like to think of this as my way of apologizing to my old high school teachers. Sorry Mr. Swanson and Mrs. Ayres, but statistics ended up being more interesting to me as a career; I still cannot thank either of you enough for the safe and welcoming environment you provided to me so many years ago in your APUSH classes.
