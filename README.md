# Project Showcase

## Welcome to all prospective viewers!

I try to host all (non-sensitive) past and current projects here. While the sensitive stuff is always the most interesting, I also value my financial wellbeing and current record of zero — that's right, zero — lawsuits for breaking confidentiality.


If anything grabs your attention and/or you would like to use for it your own purposes, then please feel more than free to grab it from my GitHub profile; link is below.
