# Project Showcase

## Welcome to all prospective viewers!

I try to host all (non-sensitive) past and current projects here[^1]. If anything grabs your attention and/or you would like to use for it your own purposes, then please feel more than free to grab it from my GitHub profile; link is left.

[^1]: While the sensitive stuff is always the most interesting, I also value my financial wellbeing and current record of zero — that's right, zero — lawsuits for breaking confidentiality.

Also to the left is a personal project of mine: a long list of statistical analytic resources to help those that also struggle with the conceptual side of mathematical theory. I've also collected links for the textbooks I've used throughout my Master's program at UCLA for download; I heavily indebted myself to the UC system to find out about them, but that doesn't mean you have to, too. There is also a small collection of study guides I've made for a few of my classes.

## Short Overview of Current Skillset

For a more technical and exhaustive insight, I encourage anyone curious to look through my projects portfolio on the left. You can also take them after looking, too! I literally can't stop you.

**Technical:**
- *Machine learning*: Regularization and variable selection (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net), regression trees and random forests, propagation methods, and stochastic gradient descent.

- *Data analysis*: Cleaning, imputation, transformation, and visualization; familiar with data trawling/scraping.

- *Statistics*: A/B and A/A testing, conjoint analysis, linear and non-linear (Logit, Probit, Tobit) regression, non-parametric (KDE, k-NN, SVM) and semiparametric (GMM) estimation; low and high-dimensionality in stochastic and non-stochastic contexts.

**Software**
- *Proficient*: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Sklearn, etc.), MySQL, Tableau

- *Familiar*: AWS, R, Git/Github, STATA, PowerBI
