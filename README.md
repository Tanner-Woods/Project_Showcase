# Professional Showcase

## Welcome to all prospective viewers!

I try to host all (non-sensitive) past and current projects here[^1]. If anything grabs your attention and/or you would like to use for it your own purposes, then please feel more than free to grab it from my GitHub profile; link is to the left.

[^1]: While the sensitive stuff is always the most interesting, I also value my financial wellbeing and current record of zero — that's right, zero — lawsuits for breaking confidentiality.

Also to the left is a personal project of mine: a long list of statistical analytic resources to help those that also struggle with the conceptual side of mathematical theory. I've collected links for the textbooks I've used throughout my graduate program at UCLA for download; I heavily indebted myself to the UC system to find out about them, but that doesn't mean you have to, too. There is also a small collection of study guides I've made for a few of my classes.

## Professional History

**Companion Care Veterinary Hospital** <br>
Title: Data Scientist. <br>
Type: 9-Month Contract.
Dates: March 2023 - December 2023.

- Constructed composited ensemble of unsupervised learning methods to identify statistically significant KPIs for approximately $10,000,000 in regularized daily revenue and infer relationships of historical price adjustments to clientele spending habits.
- Migrated SQL database from 2014 to 2022 MS-SQL Server and extracted econometrically influential parameters from invoices containing over 254,000 distinct service items for estimates of optimal fee structure and reminder frequency.
- Identified several points of interest within data space that previous analytical vendors failed to remove or adjust in the process of standardizing the space for analysis (e.g., Discount effect within invoices, emotionally traumatic events).
- Provided ad hoc reports for review and collected supplementary field data (e.g., Time-to-completion for tasks, identity of poorly documented pre-migration records, abnormal clientele backgrounds, etc.) from client.

## Project History

Constructing an Unsupervised Learning Ensemble for Outlier Detection in Activity of IRS Form 990 Organizations
- Implemented bootstrapping-by-dimensionality/feature bagging to characterize the CLT-homogenized full data space by its constituent subspaces, avoid the combinatorial explosion effect, and mitigate knowledge bias effect in training.
- Applied high-dimensional outlier detection methods without pre-clustering steps (iForest, ECOD, COPOD) to produce global measures of outlierness that avoid the recursive subspace-neighborhood search problem.
- Built locality-boosted global outlierness metric from the composited nonparametric Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients of additive/multiplicative global-to-local and intra-local outlierness.

Forecasting the Logarithmic Fraction of Outstanding Shares Under Competing Supervised Learning Models
- Most optimal model by testing performance determined as the autoregressive model with multilayer perceptron tuning at an R-squared of 0.4623 and RMSE of 0.1720; comfortably exceeded typical industry threshold of ~70% .
- Implemented hyperparameter-tunable models for autoregression with elastic net regularization and multilayer perceptrons, random forest with AdaBoost/XGBoost, and LSTM learning. 
- Constructed bespoke temporally aware cross-validation method appropriate for time-series data spaces.

Constructing a Predictive Model for Quota Fulfillment in Textile Workers
- Compared competing neural network, classic non-parametric estimation (k-NN), supervised support vector machine, and logit models to determine whether a given factory cohort would meet their quota.
- Concluded that a supervised SVM model with grid-search cross-validation produced the most optimal predictions at approximately 97% accuracy and recall[^2].
- Corrected unbalanced classes via SMOTE and ADASYN resampling techniques.

[^2]: I take this accuracy and recall with a grain of salt given the (unknown to me at the time) detriments of resampling techniques. Still an incredibly enlightening and fun project in terms of statistical methods implemented!

Note: A selection of additional projects can be found within the “Personal Project Archive” section.
