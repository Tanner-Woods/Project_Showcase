# Pictures of Cute Animals

For the last 24 years, my family has run an owner-operated boutique veterinary clinic in sunny San Diego. I grew up in and alongside to the clinic; quite literally, as the clinic opened three days before I was born. Besides everyone's favorite party topic — that is, statistics and mathematical theory — I also have a deep passion for animals of every shape and size. Every interaction with an animal is a blessing and a gift: one that I can share in some small way through cute pictures of my own animals [^1].
