# Project Showcase

## Welcome to all prospective viewers!

I try to host all (non-sensitive) past and current projects here. While the sensitive stuff is always the most interesting, I also value my financial wellbeing and current record of zero — that's right, zero — lawsuits for breaking confidentiality.


If anything grabs your attention and/or you would like to use for it your own purposes, then please feel more than free to grab it from my GitHub profile; link is left.


Also to the left is a personal project of mine[^1]: a long list of statistical analytic resources. While proper data analysis and model construction can get obscenely complicated, I believe that is more a function of many small building blocks placed one upon another upon another. The components are simple, but the end product seems daunting. As someone who always struggled with examinations and technical interviews, I only ever saw the latter rather than the former. From a combination of my personal notes and text resources, I hope to compile an easily digestable resource for folks like me: the ones who love what statistics can do for them and others, but are intimidated by the hurdle that is **lots of math**.

[^1]: I wanted to be a history teacher when I first started my undergrad at UC Santa Cruz, so I think this is my way of apologizing to my old high school teachers. Sorry Mr. Swanson and Mrs. Ayres, statistics ended up being more interesting to me as a career; I still cannot thank either of you enough for the safe and welcoming environment you provided to me so many years ago in your APUSH classes.

If you can recite PEMDAS, then I believe anyone can do statistical analysis. It's simply a function of your time, which I hope to minimize; I do encourage everyone to dive deeper into outside resources, because I can ultimately only hope to scratch the surface of such an expansive and dynamic field.

## Short Overview of Current Skillset

For a more technical and exhaustive insight, I encourage anyone curious to look through my projects portfolio on the left. You can also take them after looking, too! I literally can't stop you.

**Technical:**
- *Machine learning*: Regularization and variable selection (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net), regression trees and random forests, propagation methods, and stochastic gradient descent.

- *Data analysis*: Cleaning, imputation, transformation, and visualization; familiar with data trawling/scraping.

- *Statistics*: A/B and A/A testing, conjoint analysis, linear and non-linear (Logit, Probit, Tobit) regression, non-parametric (KDE, k-NN, SVM) and semiparametric (GMM) estimation; low and high-dimensionality in stochastic and non-stochastic contexts.

**Software**
- *Proficient*: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Sklearn, etc.), MySQL, Tableau

- *Familiar*: AWS, R, Git/Github, STATA, PowerBI
