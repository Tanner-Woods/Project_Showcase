| Anomaly Analysis in Tax-Exempt Non-Profit Organization Filings: Applying Unsupervised Learning Method Ensembles on 2013-2021 IRS Form 990s to Perform Outlier Detection as a Measure of Anomalous Activity I|

| **Description**: Implemented bootstrapping-by-dimensionality/feature bagging to characterize the CLT-homogenized full data space by its constituent subspaces, avoid the combinatorial explosion effect, and mitigate knowledge bias effect in training. Applied high-dimensional outlier detection methods without pre-clustering steps (iForest, ECOD, COPOD) to produce global measures of outlierness that avoid the recursive subspace-neighborhood search problem. Constructed general and annualized locality-boosted global outlierness metric with composited Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients of additive/multiplicative global-to-local and intra-local outlierness.|

| Complementary vs. Substitution Effects of Uber on Public Transit Consumption | [Link](https://tanner-woods.github.io/Personal_Projects/Econometrics_and_Finance/Complementary Effects of Uber on Public Transit.html) | 

| **Description**: Attempt at reproducing results derived from "Is Uber a substitute or complement for public transit?" from Hall, Palsson, and Price through several traditional regression methods. Final determination from authors states that Uber is a complement for public transit ridership: mean ridership increases by approximately 5% after two years.|
| **Conclusion**: Unsuccesful reproduction of study results in 2/4 regressions implementing DoubleOLS; produced small to moderate negative marginal effects on public transit usage.Another DoubleOLS regression produced an outsized positive marginal effect approximately 32.85% greater than the study's, while final relevant DoubleOLS controlling for trips above median produced positive marginal effect approximately 0.6281% smaller than the study's.|

| Is There Evidence for Deadweight Profit Loss in the Warehousing Industry Due to Working Conditions | [Link](https://tanner-woods.github.io/Personal_Projects/Econometrics_and_Finance/Deadweight Loss in the Warehousing Industry Due to Working Conditions.pdf) |

| **Description**: Major media stories report the prescence of poor working conditions in the warehousing industry, as well as high rates of employee turnover. By constructing an approximate per worker valuation of productivity through per worker share of Amazon's net annual net income, we hope to estimate potential sources of their profit loss.|
| **Conclusion**: 

- Model 3 produced statistically significant estimates of approximately -$5,516 (2.5%) and $1,619 (1%) for marginal median days missed and mean weekly hours of work, while possessing an approximate R-Squared of 0.793. 

- Model 4 produced statistically significant estimates of approximately -$7,235 (1%) and $2,173 (1%) for marginal total incidents and median days missed , while possessing an approximate R-Squared of 0.721

- Model 5 produced several highly statisticall signficant results, but estimated coefficients are highly outsized and should likely be disregarded.|
